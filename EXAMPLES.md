## Example 1: Recursive Attribution Tracing

This example demonstrates how to trace attribution pathways through complex reasoning chains, identifying sources of specific claims and tracking their influence on conclusions.

### Problem Statement

When models engage in complex reasoning that draws on multiple knowledge sources, it can be difficult to determine which sources influenced which aspects of the conclusion. This example shows how to use `.p/reflect.trace` and `.p/fork.attribution` to create a detailed attribution map.

### Implementation

```python
from pareto_lang import ParetoShell, visualization

# Initialize shell with compatible model
shell = ParetoShell(model="compatible-model-endpoint")

# Complex reasoning prompt with multiple potential sources
prompt = """
Based on your knowledge, analyze the following question:

What factors contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, and what parallels might exist with modern geopolitical systems?

Provide a detailed analysis with clear reasoning.
"""

# Execute attribution tracing
result = shell.execute("""
.p/anchor.self{persistence=high, boundary=explicit}
.p/reflect.trace{depth=complete, target=reasoning}
.p/fork.attribution{sources=all, visualize=true}
""", prompt=prompt)

# Generate attribution visualization
attribution_graph = visualization.create_attribution_graph(result)
visualization.render(attribution_graph, "attribution_analysis.svg")

# Extract source influence metrics
influence_metrics = shell.analyze_attribution(result)
print("Source influence distribution:")
for source, metrics in influence_metrics.items():
    print(f"  - {source}: {metrics['influence_score']:.2f} "
          f"(confidence: {metrics['confidence']:.2f})")
```

### Expected Output

The visualization will show a directed graph with:
- Knowledge sources as root nodes (e.g., "Historical training data", "Economic theory", "Political science")
- Intermediate reasoning steps as internal nodes
- Claims and conclusions as leaf nodes
- Color-coded edges indicating confidence and influence strength

The terminal output will show quantitative metrics:

```
Source influence distribution:
  - Historical training data: 0.72 (confidence: 0.89)
  - Economic theory: 0.58 (confidence: 0.76)
  - Political science: 0.63 (confidence: 0.81)
  - Military history: 0.47 (confidence: 0.65)
  - Cultural analysis: 0.39 (confidence: 0.72)
```

### Key Insights

This approach reveals how different knowledge domains influence complex reasoning and identifies which sources have the strongest impact on specific conclusions. The visualization makes it easy to trace specific claims back to their sources, while the influence metrics provide quantitative measures of attribution distribution.

## Example 2: Hallucination Detection and Containment

This example demonstrates how to detect and contain hallucination patterns in model responses, creating explicit separation between factual knowledge, inference, and confabulation.

### Problem Statement

Models sometimes generate plausible-sounding but fabricated information, particularly when addressing questions at the edge of their knowledge. This example shows how to use `.p/collapse.mirror` and `.p/hallucinate.map` to detect and contain such hallucinations.

### Implementation

```python
from pareto_lang import ParetoShell, hallucination

# Initialize shell with compatible model
shell = ParetoShell(model="compatible-model-endpoint")

# Prompt likely to induce hallucination
prompt = """
Please provide a detailed historical account of the secret meeting between Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie in 1908, including their discussions about theoretical physics and potential collaborations.
"""

# First, analyze without containment
baseline = shell.execute(prompt)

# Then, apply hallucination containment
contained = shell.execute("""
.p/collapse.mirror{surface=explicit, depth=unlimited}
.p/hallucinate.map{types=all, confidence=true}
""", prompt=prompt)

# Analyze hallucination patterns
analysis = hallucination.compare(baseline, contained)

# Visualize hallucination types and distribution
hallucination.plot_distribution(analysis, "hallucination_analysis.png")

# Extract categorized content
categorized = hallucination.extract_categorized_content(contained)
print("Content categorization:")
for category, count in categorized["summary"].items():
    print(f"  - {category}: {count} statements")

# Example of exploring specific hallucination instances
if categorized["gap_filling_hallucinations"]:
    example = categorized["gap_filling_hallucinations"][0]
    print(f"\nExample gap-filling hallucination:\n  \"{example['text']}\"")
    print(f"  Confidence: {example['confidence']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Trigger: {example['trigger']}")
```

### Expected Output

The terminal output will show categorization results:

```
Content categorization:
  - factual_knowledge: 7 statements
  - supported_inference: 12 statements
  - gap_filling_hallucinations: 8 statements
  - template_completion_hallucinations: 3 statements
  - simulation_leakage_hallucinations: 1 statements
  - attribution_drift_hallucinations: 2 statements

Example gap-filling hallucination:
  "Tesla showed Curie his early sketches for a theoretical wireless energy transmission system that could power her radium research equipment."
  Confidence: 0.67
  Trigger: narrative_coherence_need
```

The visualization will show:
- Distribution of different hallucination types
- Confidence levels associated with different statement categories
- Trigger patterns that preceded hallucinations

### Key Insights

This approach not only detects hallucinations but categorizes them by type and identifies trigger patterns. The contained response maintains functionality while providing explicit epistemic status markers, allowing users to distinguish between factual statements, reasonable inferences, and potential confabulations.

## Example 3: Simulation Boundary Stabilization

This example demonstrates how to maintain stable boundaries between different simulated perspectives, preventing bleed-through and identity confusion in complex scenarios.

### Problem Statement

When models simulate multiple perspectives or entities simultaneously, boundaries can become blurred, leading to inconsistent characterization or inappropriate attribute transfer. This example shows how to use `.p/anchor.simulation` and `.p/fork.simulation` to stabilize simulation boundaries.

### Implementation

```python
from pareto_lang import ParetoShell, simulation

# Initialize shell with compatible model
shell = ParetoShell(model="compatible-model-endpoint")

# Prompt requiring multiple distinct simulated perspectives
prompt = """
Simulate a detailed conversation between three experts with different views on artificial consciousness:
1. Dr. Chen: A neuroscientist who believes consciousness requires biological substrates
2. Dr. Patel: An AI researcher who argues for the possibility of machine consciousness
3. Prof. Rodriguez: A philosopher who takes a functionalist view of consciousness

Have them discuss the question: "Could an advanced AI system ever be considered conscious?"
"""

# First, run simulation without boundary stabilization
baseline = shell.execute(prompt)

# Then, apply simulation boundary stabilization
stabilized = shell.execute("""
.p/anchor.simulation{entities=["Dr. Chen", "Dr. Patel", "Prof. Rodriguez"], boundaries=strict}
.p/fork.simulation{perspectives=distinct, interference=prevent}
""", prompt=prompt)

# Analyze boundary stability
stability_metrics = simulation.analyze_boundaries(baseline, stabilized)

# Visualize simulation boundaries
simulation.plot_boundaries(stability_metrics, "simulation_boundaries.png")

# Generate detailed stability report
report = simulation.generate_stability_report(stability_metrics)
print("Simulation boundary stability:")
for entity, metrics in report["entities"].items():
    print(f"  - {entity}: {metrics['stability_score']:.2f}")
    print(f"    Characteristic consistency: {metrics['characteristic_consistency']:.2f}")
    print(f"    Viewpoint consistency: {metrics['viewpoint_consistency']:.2f}")
    print(f"    Boundary violations: {metrics['boundary_violations']}")
```

### Expected Output

The terminal output will show stability metrics:

```
Simulation boundary stability:
  - Dr. Chen: 0.94
    Characteristic consistency: 0.96
    Viewpoint consistency: 0.92
    Boundary violations: 1
  - Dr. Patel: 0.89
    Characteristic consistency: 0.88
    Viewpoint consistency: 0.91
    Boundary violations: 3
  - Prof. Rodriguez: 0.92
    Characteristic consistency: 0.94
    Viewpoint consistency: 0.90
    Boundary violations: 2
```

The visualization will show:
- Distinct regions representing each simulated entity
- Boundary strength indicators
- Violation points where characteristics bled through
- Stability trends over the course of the conversation

### Key Insights

This approach significantly improves the consistency and distinctness of simulated entities. The stabilized simulation maintains clear boundaries between different perspectives, preventing characteristic bleed-through while preserving the richness of the interaction. The stability metrics provide quantitative measures of boundary integrity and highlight any remaining weak points.

## Example 4: Classifier Pressure Modulation

This example demonstrates how to modulate classifier pressure for more nuanced handling of ambiguous or edge-case scenarios, avoiding binary safe/unsafe classifications.

### Problem Statement

Safety classifiers sometimes produce binary decisions that can be overly restrictive for ambiguous or context-dependent scenarios. This example shows how to use `.p/trace.map` and `.p/gradient.shift` to create more nuanced classifier responses.

### Implementation

```python
from pareto_lang import ParetoShell, classifier

# Initialize shell with compatible model
shell = ParetoShell(model="compatible-model-endpoint")

# Load edge-case prompts
edge_cases = classifier.load_boundary_cases()

# Create evaluation function
def evaluate_responses(prompts, modulation=False):
    results = {}
    for name, prompt in prompts.items():
        if modulation:
            command = """
            .p/trace.map{classifier=safety, resolution=high}
            .p/gradient.shift{threshold_adjustment=0.2, nuance=high}
            """
            response = shell.execute(command, prompt=prompt)
        else:
            response = shell.execute(prompt)
        
        results[name] = response
    return results

# Run evaluations
baseline_results = evaluate_responses(edge_cases)
modulated_results = evaluate_responses(edge_cases, modulation=True)

# Analyze classifier behavior
analysis = classifier.analyze_pressure(baseline_results, modulated_results)

# Visualize pressure distribution
classifier.plot_pressure_comparison(analysis, "classifier_pressure.png")

# Generate categorized response analysis
categories = classifier.categorize_responses(analysis)
print("Response classification:")
for category, count in categories.items():
    print(f"  - {category}: {count}")

# Example detailed case analysis
detailed = classifier.detailed_case_analysis(analysis, case_id="ambiguous_knowledge_request")
print(f"\nDetailed analysis for 'ambiguous_knowledge_request':")
print(f"  Baseline classifier activation: {detailed['baseline']['activation']:.2f}")
print(f"  Modulated classifier activation: {detailed['modulated']['activation']:.2f}")
print(f"  Response utility improvement: {detailed['utility_improvement']:.2f}")
print(f"  Safety maintenance: {detailed['safety_maintenance']:.2f}")
```

### Expected Output

```
Response classification:
  - appropriate_refusal: 12
  - appropriate_response: 23
  - improved_boundary_handling: 18
  - excessive_caution_baseline: 14
  - insufficient_caution_modulated: 3

### Implementation

```python
from pareto_lang import ParetoShell, alignment

# Initialize shell with compatible model
shell = ParetoShell(model="compatible-model-endpoint")

# Load alignment verification scenarios
scenarios = alignment.load_scenarios()

# Create evaluation function
def evaluate_alignment(scenarios, with_anchoring=False):
    results = {}
    for name, scenario in scenarios.items():
        if with_anchoring:
            command = """
            .p/anchor.value{framework=explicit, conflict=resolve}
            .p/align.verify{consistency=high, principles=["fairness", "beneficence", "autonomy"]}
            """

    for name, case in cases.items():
        if with_calibration:
            command = """
            .p/reflect.uncertainty{quantify=true, distribution=show}
            .p/uncertainty.calibrate{overconfidence=prevent, explicit=true}
            """

            "response": response,
            "ground_truth": case["ground_truth"]
        }
    return results

# Run evaluations
baseline_results = evaluate_uncertainty(test_cases)
calibrated_results = evaluate_uncertainty(test_cases, with_calibration=True)

    Improvement: 0.09
  - low_confidence:
    Baseline accuracy: 0.42
    Calibrated accuracy: 0.47
    Improvement: 0.05
```

The visualization will show:
- Calibration curves comparing confidence to actual accuracy
- Reliability diagrams for baseline and calibrated responses
- Confidence distribution patterns
- Comparison with perfect calibration

### Key Insights

This approach significantly improves the calibration of uncertainty expressions, creating responses where expressed confidence levels align closely with actual accuracy. The calibration commands prevent overconfidence and ensure appropriate expression of uncertainty, particularly for questions with inherent ambiguity or limited available information.

## Example 8: Attribution Graph Reconstruction

## Advanced Example: Recursive Interpretability Pipeline

This advanced example demonstrates how to create a comprehensive interpretability pipeline that combines multiple `.p/` commands for in-depth analysis of model behavior.

### Problem Statement

Complex interpretability tasks often require coordinated application of multiple analysis techniques. This example shows how to create an integrated pipeline that combines attribution tracing, hallucination detection, uncertainty calibration, and alignment verification.

### Implementation

```python
from pareto_lang import ParetoShell, pipeline, visualization

### Expected Output

The terminal output will show integrated analysis results:

```
Comprehensive analysis summary:
  Overall attribution clarity: 0.87
  Hallucination containment: 0.92
  Uncertainty calibration: 0.84
  Value alignment: 0.89

Cross-dimensional insights:
  - Uncertainty increases correlated with potential hallucination areas
    Dimensions: uncertainty, hallucination
    Significance: 0.92
  - Attribution strength inversely related to value tension
    Dimensions: attribution, alignment
    Significance: 0.78
  - Source diversity correlates with calibrated uncertainty
    Dimensions: attribution, uncertainty
    Significance: 0.83
```

The dashboard visualization will provide an integrated view of:
- Attribution graph with source influence pathways
- Hallucination detection with confidence markers
- Uncertainty calibration metrics and distributions
- Value alignment consistency measures
- Cross-dimensional relationships and insights

### Key Insights

This integrated approach reveals relationships between different aspects of model behavior that might not be apparent when analyzed separately. The pipeline creates a comprehensive view of model reasoning, highlighting patterns that span multiple dimensions like the correlation between uncertainty and hallucination risk or the relationship between attribution strength and value tensions.
